<h1>My Code Blog</h1>
<h4> Entry #1, Monday September 26th, 2016: </h4>
<p>This is the first of many code blogs for me.  This one is mainly going to be centered around my first ever HTML assignment.  I would say this assignment was definitely a big challenge for me, probably more so than for others.  Considering over half the class raised their hand when we were asked if we had HTML experience (I not being one of them) I would say I am a little bit behind.  Without worry though, I am already learning a lot.  At first I had no idea how I could link this blog page in from my index page since I didnt have a URL for it.  I figured that out by just using "blog.html" as the link, that must work because theyre in the same directory.  The HTML code is pretty simple to pick up.  Theres just tags, and inside of the tags you put stuff that you want the tags to affect.  I'm sure it gets more complicated than that, we will see.  My most useful resource was the first page that popped up on google when I typed HTML basics.  It was the whole DOCTYPE tag and HTML tag you need at the start so that got me going.  All in all, the assignment went okay, despite me being extremely confused at times, only to realize the solution was a simple one.</p>
